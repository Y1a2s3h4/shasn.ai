# SHASN Consolidated Rulebook

## Introduction

You are a politician in the middle of a heated election. Prepare to make tough policy decisions, earn and manage resources and voters, adapt to the changing news landscape, and find yourself in constant stages of negotiation and sabotage. Experience the short-term and long-term pressures of decision making and be alert to the constantly shifting balance of power.

## Overview

As a politician in SHASN, you must answer political dilemmas, manage resources, build ideologies, influence voters and form majorities. Players can also forge alliances, scheme and conspire, and negotiate with their political rivals.

### Objective
The game ends when majorities have been formed in all zones. The player with the most majority voters wins.

## Setup

- Each player selects a player mat and its corresponding bag of voters.
- All players vote to determine who starts as player one. In case of a tie, vote again. Players cannot vote for themselves.
- Player 1 receives any 1 resource of their choice, Player 2 receives any 2 resources, Player 3 receives any 3 resources, Player 4 receives any 4 resources, and Player 5 (if playing) receives any 5 resources from the Public Reserve. *(Designer's Note - This is to offset the Player 1 advantage)*
- Select a campaign. You may remove any Ideology Cards based on Content Advisory if desired.
- Shuffle the campaign's corresponding decks of Ideology Cards, Conspiracy Cards, and Headline Cards.
- After all players have received their resources, shuffle the deck of Vote Bank/Voter Cards and open the top three cards on the HQ Mat/board.

## Gameplay Overview

### Order of Turn

- Turns are in clockwise order. At the start of a player's turn, the player on their right draws a card from the deck of Ideology Cards and reads it aloud to them.
- Players begin their turn by answering an Ideology Card.
- They receive the corresponding resources from it and any other resources they earn from passive Ideologue Powers.
- Each player has a resource cap of 12. Before taking any other actions, players have to choose and discard any excess resources down to 12.

Players can take the remaining actions in their turn in any order:
- Spend resources to influence voters from open Vote Bank/Voter Cards.
- Form majorities by influencing more than half the voters in a zone.
- Buy or use Conspiracy Cards - these can be used immediately or saved for later.
- Trade resources and Conspiracy Cards amongst each other.
- Gerrymander voters if applicable.
- Trigger Headline Cards if applicable.
- Form or collapse coalitions in their turn (in some versions).
- A player ends their turn by drawing and reading an Ideology Card for the next player.

## Ideology Cards

These Ideology Cards pose contemporary policy questions with a different answer on each side, yielding a separate set of resources. The player reading out the Ideology Card must hide these resources.

During their turn, the player must choose between the two available answers, depending on their needs and beliefs. After confirming their answer, they repeat it aloud and keep the Ideology Card under their Player Mat with the answer face-up. They receive the corresponding resources from the Public Resource Box. The resources of each answer should not be revealed to the player until they have locked their answer.

Each answer also corresponds to a political ideology, indicated by the colored band at the bottom of the card. You will build ideologies over the course of the game and unlock exciting powers.

## Resources

The game uses four types of resources:

- **Campaign Funds**: If there is a profit to be made, someone's making it. Earn the support and funds of industry giants by promising business-friendly practices and creating market demand through your policies.
- **Street Clout**: If politics is a numbers game, leaders that appeal to the majority set themselves up for success. Accumulate clout quickly by tending to populist sentiments and engaging in identity politics.
- **Media Attention**: In an era of media saturation, it is vital for politicians to maximise visibility in the public eye. If you choose to baffle, entertain and outrage with your words, you will earn lots of media attention.
- **Public Trust**: Intention matters. When you seek to create a world where all can engage in the pursuit of happiness, regardless of who they are, where they come from, or the pragmatism of change, you will earn people's trust.

All four resources are equally important and are used to influence voters, buy Conspiracies, and take special actions.

## Resource Trading and Cap

- Players must earn resources to influence Vote Bank/Voter Cards. They get resources from Ideology Cards and Ideologue Powers.
- Players have a resource cap of 12. Any additional resources over 12 must be discarded before a player can continue with their turn. A player can choose which excess resources to discard.
- Players can trade resources with each other. In some versions, trade must be equitable (1 for 1, 2 for 2 and so on), while other versions allow any ratio as long as at least 1 resource is exchanged by both parties.
- At least one player must be the active player for a trade to occur.
- There is no limit to the number of resources that can be traded per turn.

## Influencing Voters

- Three Vote Bank/Voter Cards will always remain open on the HQ Mat/board.
- After influencing a Vote Bank/Voter Card (of 1, 2 or 3 voters), a player must place that many voters on the board in any zone.
- Any influenced voters must be placed on the board by the end of the same turn. Failure to do so will lead to these voters being discarded.
- The voters from a single Vote Bank/Voter Card cannot be split across zones. Voters obtained from any other means can be split.
- An influenced Vote Bank/Voter Card is added to the discard pile and a new one is opened in its place.
- Players can buy multiple Vote Bank/Voter Cards in their turn, as many as their resources allow.
- If there aren't enough empty areas left in any one zone to place the influenced voters from a single Vote Bank/Voter Card, all voters from that card get discarded.

## Forming a Majority

Influenced voters are placed on the board in an attempt to form majorities and capture zones. Every zone has its own fixed number of voters. A player needs to influence more than 50% of the voters in a zone to form the majority in that zone. This required number of voters is denoted by the fraction on each zone.

- A majority is formed in a zone immediately after its majority requirement is met.
- After forming the majority in a zone, flip over as many voters as were required to form the majority, with the party symbol/'S' side up. Each majority voter with the symbol side up denotes 1 point earned.
- Only the number of flipped majority voters count towards a player's final total in the game. Placing any more voters in a zone after forming a majority will not earn any additional points and will be kept with the blank side up.
- Forming a majority also unlocks the Gerrymandering power.
- The voters used to form a majority are immune to Gerrymandering, unless specified otherwise.

## Breaking Majorities

- A majority can be broken through certain powers and effects. If you no longer have enough voters to meet the majority requirement of a zone, your majority breaks. Flip over your remaining voters blank side up.

## Gerrymandering

Gerrymandering is an important strategy to slow opponents down by dispersing their votes.

Forming a majority in a zone gives a player influence in all neighbouring zones (with shared boundary lines). The player can now gerrymander voters every turn, i.e., move around voters in adjoining zones.

Players can gerrymander a voter into an adjoining zone, into their majority zone, or in between two adjoining zones.

- Gerrymandering must happen between zones with a shared boundary line.
- Players can only gerrymander non-majority voters, i.e., voters that are not used to form majorities (unless specified otherwise).
- Players can gerrymander their own voters or an opponent's voters.
- Every turn, players can gerrymander one voter per majority that they control.
- Gerrymandering can only be used in zones with individual majorities, not coalitions (in versions that include coalitions).

## Coalitions (In some versions)

Two players can jointly form the majority in a zone and control it together by forming a coalition. The total of their combined votes must meet the majority requirement of that zone.

- In a coalition, players can split the majority votes in any ratio, open to negotiation.
- When a coalition is formed, the two players must exchange an Ideology Card with each other. This card must belong to the ideology that they hold the most cards of. This represents the ideological cost of compromise.
- The gerrymandering power of a zone can't be used when a coalition is formed there.
- Players can form coalitions with different parties in different zones. Ideology Cards must be traded for every new coalition that is formed.
- A coalition will break when one of the two players declares withdrawal.
- The Ideology Cards that were swapped will not be returned to the players. New coalitions can be formed in a zone if an old one collapses.
- Withdrawal can be declared at any point during the game, with no cost.

## Auction (In some versions)

- Certain events in the game will initiate an auction.
- You can bid up to as many resources as your resource cap during an auction. You do not need to hold the number of resources you bid. If you win the bid, you can pay off the bid amount in successive turns. The seller can keep track of how many resources you owe them.
- However, you cannot make any purchases until you have completely paid off your bid.
- If nobody places a bid for your auctioned item, discard it and receive the minimum bid value from the Public Reserve.

## Ideologues

- While answering an Ideology Card in their turn, players have two answers to choose from. Both answers belong to different ideologies, denoted by the colored band at the bottom of the card.
- As players answer Ideology Cards, they build their ideologies over the course of the game and unlock Ideologue Powers.
- There are 4 Ideologues in the game:
  - The Capitalist
  - The Showman/Showstopper
  - The Supremo
  - The Idealist
- Gathering 4 Ideology Cards of a single Ideologue unlocks the corresponding Level 4 power. Similarly, collecting 6 Ideology Cards of a single Ideologue unlocks the corresponding Level 6 power.
- Every Ideologue also has a passive power: for every 2 Ideology Cards of a single type, players get 1 corresponding resource at the start of their turn.
- Ideologue Powers can be used in the same turn as they are unlocked.
- All Ideologue Powers stack up. A player can access multiple powers belonging to different Ideologues at the same time.
- Players can use their unlocked Ideologue Powers every turn for the rest of the game, as long as they hold the corresponding Ideology Cards.
- Stick to your beliefs, as Level 6 Ideologue Powers are extremely powerful and can break majorities.

## Volatile Zones/Areas

- Each zone has one or more volatile zones marked with a black circle. Placing a voter peg in a volatile zone triggers a Headline Card.
- A voter peg in a volatile zone stays there permanently. It cannot be converted, discarded, moved or gerrymandered even with Level 6 Ideologue Powers.
- Players can either put their own voter in a volatile zone, or an opponent's voter, through gerrymandering.


# Headline Cards

Headline Cards are an array of opportunities and punishments that begin negotiations, boosting or hindering a player's gameplay.

- After being triggered, Headlines are read at the end of the player's turn.
- The Headline applies to the player whose voter peg is placed in the volatile zone.
- Headlines apply for one turn only (unless specified otherwise).
- Headlines cannot be Blocked or Reversed.
- Headlines are resolved at the end of the current player's turn.
- The word **"opponent"** refers to all players except you.
- The word **"player"** refers to all players in the game, including you.

> **Designer’s Note:** As 70% of Headline Cards are negative, it might be more beneficial to put an opponent’s voter in a volatile zone.

## Scoring and End-Game

- The game ends when a majority has been formed in every zone. The player with the maximum number of majority votes wins. Congratulations, and good luck with your new world order.
- Non-majority votes do not add to a player's final tally.

### End Game Clause
- If every single vote on the board has been cast, the final round of the game begins, starting with the player that cast the final vote. The rest of the players now have one final turn each to form or collapse coalitions, use Conspiracy Cards, negotiate, etc.

*Note - During the end game, if there aren't enough empty spaces left on the board to place a group of influenced voters from a single Vote Bank Card, those voters get discarded.*

## Ideologue Powers Explained

**Passive:** Every Ideologue has a passive resource input power. For every 2 Ideology Cards of a single type, players earn 1 resource corresponding to that Ideology. For instance, having 2 'The Capitalist' cards will get a player 1 free 'Funds' resource each turn. Having 4 'The Capitalist' cards will get them 2 free 'Funds' resources every turn and so on.

Players get these additional resources when they answer the Ideology Card at the start of their turn. Players keep receiving free resources every turn as long as they hold the corresponding Ideology Cards.

### The Capitalist

influencing a Voter Card.
- You can split your discounts on 2 purchases, or combine them
on the same purchase.

**LEVEL 5 - Tough Love:

convert 2 of an opponent’s voters into yours (including majority
voters).
- The 2 converted voters must belong to the same player in the
same zone.

- This power’s cost can be discounted using The Idealist Level 3
Power.
